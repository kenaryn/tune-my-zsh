Rationale
=========
[Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.net) is a powerful shell and it may be cumbersome, time-consuming and error-prone to configure all your personal settings. Losing all your efforts after a hard drive failure or a system crash account for a greater loss of time and energy.
Furthermore, if one may want to exploit advanced features from its [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) framework could lead to an even further loss, both in morale and in endless hours of reconfiguring.

That why tune-my-zsh was devised in order to provide a simple way to automate this kind of task and start to benefit from a new and proper working environment.


## Dependencies
tune-my-zsh require the following dependencies:
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* fonts-powerline
* fonts-firacode
* [sublime-text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html)


## Who will benefit from it?
Everyone who likes to code with sublime-text and would like to try Z shell to enhance your system's administration capabilities.


## Road map
### 0.0.2:
* Add standard error outputs redirection for logging purpose.

### 0.0.1:
* Finalize code for a minimum viable product.

## Notes
tune-my-zsh is entirely written in Zsh 5.7.1 and will set by default the [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) theme.
